<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Welcome to Pathfinding Visualizer! I built this application because I was fascinated by pathfinding algorithms, and I wanted to visualize them in action. I hope that you enjoy playing around with this visualization tool just as much as I enjoyed building it. You can access it here

This application supports the following algorithms:

Dijkstra's Algorithm (weighted): the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path

A Search* (weighted): arguably the best pathfinding algorithm; uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm

Greedy Best-first Search (weighted): a faster, more heuristic-heavy version of A*; does not guarantee the shortest path

Swarm Algorithm (weighted): a mixture of Dijkstra's Algorithm and A*; does not guarantee the shortest-path

Convergent Swarm Algorithm (weighted): the faster, more heuristic-heavy version of Swarm; does not guarantee the shortest path

Bidirectional Swarm Algorithm (weighted): Swarm from both sides; does not guarantee the shortest path

Breath-first Search (unweighted): a great algorithm; guarantees the shortest path

Depth-first Search (unweighted): a very bad algorithm for pathfinding; does not guarantee the shortest path

On top of the pathfinding algorithms listed above, I implemented a Recursive Division Maze Generation algorithm.
